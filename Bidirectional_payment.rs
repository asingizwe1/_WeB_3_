Bi-directional payment channels allow participants Alice and Bob to repeatedly transfer Ether off chain.
Payments can go both ways, Alice pays Bob and Bob pays Alice.
OFF CHAIN payments are cheaper than on-chain payments.
// This is a simple implementation of a bi-directional payment channel between Alice and Bob.
