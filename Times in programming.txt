Compile time is the period when your code is being converted from human-readable source code (like .rs files) into a machine-readable binary (like an executable .exe or .out file).
The compiler (e.g., rustc) checks for:

Syntax errors

Type errors (wrong types, mismatched types)

Borrowing and ownership violations (in Rust!)

Missing semicolons, etc.


Run time is when your compiled program is actually running, and the computer is executing the instructions line-by-line.What happens at run time:
Your code executes

Variables get actual values

Loops run, functions are called

Files may be opened

Network connections are made

Errors may happen (like division by zero, out-of-bounds access, etc.)
