Advantages of using Box<T> (heap allocation)

Storing values of unknown or large size

The stack is small and fast, but limited.

If you have a very large data structure (e.g., a huge array or deeply nested type), keeping it on the heap avoids stack overflows.

Box<T> just stores a small pointer on the stack, while the real data lives in heap memory.

let big_vec = Box::new([0u8; 1_000_000]); // Stored on heap instead of stack


Enabling recursive types

Rust requires knowing the size of types at compile time. Recursive types like linked lists or trees don’t have a known size without indirection.

Box<T> solves this by providing a fixed-size pointer, breaking the infinite recursion.

enum List {
    Node(i32, Box<List>),
    Nil,
}


Transfer of ownership without copying big data

Moving a Box<T> is cheap because it only moves the pointer, not the whole data.

This is useful when passing large structures around functions.

Trait objects / dynamic dispatch

If you want to store a type that implements a trait but don’t know its size at compile time (dyn Trait), you need a pointer type like Box<dyn Trait>.

trait Shape { fn draw(&self); }
struct Circle;
impl Shape for Circle { fn draw(&self) { println!("Circle"); } }

let shape: Box<dyn Shape> = Box::new(Circle);
shape.draw();


Deterministic deallocation

Unlike Rc or Arc, a Box<T> is deallocated as soon as it goes out of scope, giving you predictable memory management without reference counting overhead.
