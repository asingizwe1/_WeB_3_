When you convert a `&u64` (a reference to a 64-bit unsigned integer) into a `u64` (the actual value), you are **dereferencing** the reference to obtain the underlying value. Here's a detailed explanation of the **use** and **why it's necessary** in certain contexts:

---

### **Why Convert `&u64` to `u64`?**
1. **Ease of Use**:
   - In many operations, you need the value itself (`u64`) rather than a reference (`&u64`). For example:
     - Performing arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, etc.).
     - Returning the value from a function.
     - Passing the value to another function that doesn't accept a reference.

2. **Prevent Borrowing Issues**:
   - If you keep using references (`&u64`), the original value remains borrowed. If you need to modify or move the original value, the borrow might prevent it, causing compilation errors. By converting to `u64`, you make a copy and avoid these issues.

3. **Working with Traits and Ownership**:
   - Many trait implementations, like `Copy`, `Clone`, or numeric operations, operate on **values** (`u64`), not references (`&u64`). Converting from a reference allows compatibility with these traits.

### **How Does It Work?**
Dereferencing a reference converts it to its underlying value. In Rust, dereferencing a numeric reference (`&u64`) is straightforward because Rust automatically dereferences in certain contexts (called **deref coercion**). However, when you explicitly convert using `.copied()` or `*` (dereference operator), you're saying:

> "I want the value this reference points to."

### **Example: Why Conversion Is Needed**

#### Without Conversion
```rust
let map = std::collections::HashMap::from([("a", 42u64)]);
let count = map.get("a"); // `count` is an Option<&u64>
let doubled = count.unwrap() * 2; // Works because Rust auto-dereferences
```

This works here because Rust can auto-dereference `&u64` in numeric operations.

#### With Explicit Conversion
Sometimes, explicit conversion is required:
```rust
let map = std::collections::HashMap::from([("a", 42u64)]);
let count = map.get("a"); // `count` is an Option<&u64>
let doubled = count.copied().unwrap() * 2; // `.copied()` converts &u64 to u64
```

Here:
- `count.copied()` makes a **copy of the value** and converts `&u64` into `u64`.

---

### **Why Not Always Use `u64` Instead of `&u64`?**
- **References Save Memory**: If you only need to read the value without modifying it, passing around references (`&u64`) avoids copying the data unnecessarily.
- **Immutable Borrowing**: References let you borrow the value immutably, ensuring the original value isn't modified elsewhere.
- **HashMap Implementation**: When you use `HashMap::get`, it provides a reference (`&V`) to the value stored in the map to avoid copying large data unnecessarily.

---

### **When to Use `.copied()` or Dereferencing (`*`)**
Use `.copied()` or `*` when:
1. You need to perform operations on the actual value (e.g., math).
2. You need to move or modify the value independently of the original reference.
3. You need to pass the value to a function or return it from a function.

---

### **Summary**
Converting `&u64` to `u64` is useful when:
- You need the actual value for computation, function calls, or to avoid borrow restrictions.
- It makes your code more compatible with traits or operations that work with values.
