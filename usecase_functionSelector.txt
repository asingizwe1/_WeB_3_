Exactly! That's a valid use case for using a function selector combined with a low-level call like `call` or `delegatecall`. However, there are nuances depending on **how you want to achieve it** and **where the addition functionality exists**.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what youâ€™re describing and how it works:

---

### **Scenario**
You have:
1. **A function `add(uint256 a, uint256 b)`** in one contract that performs addition.
2. **Another function** in a different contract that also needs to perform addition, but instead of re-implementing the logic, you want to reuse the `add` function using its selector.

---

### **How You Would Do This**

If you know the function selector for `add(uint256,uint256)`, you can dynamically reference it in your second function. Here's an example:

#### **The "Addition" Contract (Target)**
This contains the function you want to reference:

```solidity
contract Addition {
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

---

#### **The "Main" Contract (Caller)**
This will reference and call the `add` function dynamically:

```solidity
contract Main {
    function useAddition(address target, uint256 x, uint256 y) public returns (uint256) {
        // Get the selector for the 'add(uint256,uint256)' function
        bytes4 selector = bytes4(keccak256("add(uint256,uint256)"));

        // Dynamically call the 'add' function from the target contract
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = target.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(selector, x, y));
        require(success, "Call to add function failed");

        // Decode the result of the addition
        return abi.decode(data, (uint256));
    }
}
```

---

### **What Happens Under the Hood**
1. **Selector**: The `bytes4` selector for the `add(uint256,uint256)` function is calculated.
   - `keccak256("add(uint256,uint256)")` hashes the function signature.
   - The first 4 bytes of the hash (`bytes4`) are the selector.
2. **Encoding the Data**:
   - The selector and the arguments (`x`, `y`) are encoded together using `abi.encodeWithSelector`.
3. **Dynamic Call**:
   - The `call` sends the encoded data to the `target` contract.
   - The `target` contract locates and executes the `add` function using the selector.
4. **Result**:
   - The return value from the `add` function is sent back as part of the `data` variable.
   - The `abi.decode` function extracts the result.

### **Important Considerations**
1. **Reusability**: By referencing the `add` function dynamically, you can reuse its logic without duplicating the code.
2. **Cross-Contract Calls**: This approach works even if the `add` function is in a completely different contract.
3. **Gas Costs**: Thereâ€™s an additional gas cost for the low-level call, but itâ€™s often negligible compared to redeploying or duplicating code.

---

### **When to Use This Approach**
- **Modularity**: If you have common logic (like addition, subtraction, etc.) in a utility contract and you want other contracts to reuse it.
- **Dynamic Invocation**: If the logic you need isnâ€™t hardcoded into the calling contract.
- **Avoiding Code Duplication**: For shared functionality across multiple contracts.

---

### **What Happens When the Code Runs?**
Using the example above, if you call `useAddition(target, 3, 5)`:
1. The `Main` contract will send the selector and arguments (`3`, `5`) to the `Addition` contract.
2. The `Addition` contract will execute its `add` function and return `8`.
3. The `Main` contract decodes the result (`8`) and processes it as needed.
