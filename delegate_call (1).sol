/*
The reason we are assigning the result of `delegatecall` to `(bool success, bytes memory data)` is because **`delegatecall` is a low-level function that returns two values**:

1. **`success` (type: `bool`)**:
   - Indicates whether the `delegatecall` operation succeeded or failed.
   - If the called function executed without errors, `success` will be `true`. Otherwise, it will be `false` (e.g., if there’s a revert in the called function).

2. **`data` (type: `bytes memory`)**:
   - Contains the returned data from the called function.
   - This could be the encoded return values of the function that was called using `delegatecall`.
   - If the called function doesn't return anything, this will be an empty byte array.

---

### Why Do We Need These?

When using `delegatecall`, you must handle the result because **it's not as safe or user-friendly as high-level Solidity function calls**. For example:
- If the `delegatecall` fails, it won't automatically revert the transaction. You need to check the `success` variable and decide how to handle it.
- The `data` can help you extract any return values from the delegated function.

---

### What Does This Code Do?

```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory data) = _contract.delegatecall(
    abi.encodeWithSignature("setVariable(uint256)", _num)
);
```

1. **`delegatecall` Execution**:
   - `_contract`: Address of the contract you want to delegate the call to (in this case, `B`).
   - `abi.encodeWithSignature("setVariable(uint256)", _num)`:
     - Encodes the function signature (`setVariable(uint256)`) and the parameter (`_num`).
     - This creates the input data required to call the `setVariable` function in contract `B`.

2. **Result Assignment**:
   - `bool success`: Stores whether the `delegatecall` succeeded or failed.
   - `bytes memory data`: Stores the return data from the function call.

3. **Post-Execution Handling**:
   - After the `delegatecall` completes, you can:
     - Check `success` to determine if the call succeeded.
     - Use or decode `data` to process the return values (if any).

---

### What Happens If You Don’t Handle the Return Values?

If you don’t assign the results of `delegatecall` to `(bool success, bytes memory data)`, you lose the ability to:
1. **Know if the `delegatecall` succeeded**:
   - If the call fails (e.g., due to a revert in the called function), your contract won't know, and it could lead to unexpected behavior.

2. **Access Returned Data**:
   - If the called function returns any data, you won’t be able to retrieve or process it.

### Example of Proper Error Handling:
```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory data) = _contract.delegatecall(
    abi.encodeWithSignature("setVariable(uint256)", _num)
);
require(success, "Delegatecall failed");
```
- `require(success, "Delegatecall failed")`: Ensures the transaction reverts if the delegate call fails.

---

### Summary
- We assign `(bool success, bytes memory data)` to `delegatecall` because it returns two values that are crucial for:
  1. Checking if the call succeeded (`success`).
  2. Handling or processing any returned data (`data`).
- Ignoring these results can lead to missed errors or unprocessed outputs.
