What is a Durable Nonce?
Solana transactions require a recent blockhash (used like a timestamp). Normally, these expire in about 2 minutes. But sometimes you want to:

Hold onto a transaction longer.

Get multiple signatures over time.

Sign offline or across devices.

A durable nonce is a special mechanism to extend the validity of a transaction indefinitely ‚Äî until you use or replace that nonce.

üîê Durable Nonce + Partial Signing ‚Äî Use Cases
1. Multisig with Delayed Finalization
You want multiple people to sign a transaction over a longer period (hours/days):

Use a durable nonce instead of a recent blockhash.

Each signer can sign when ready.

Final transaction stays valid until executed.

‚úÖ Use Case: DAOs or treasuries where signers are in different time zones or need manual review.

2. Cold Wallet Signing
You prepare a transaction on an online computer (with a durable nonce).

Move it to an air-gapped (cold) device.

Sign it offline.

Return it to an online device for broadcast.

‚úÖ Use Case: Secure key management for institutional holders or crypto treasuries.

3. Transaction Preview/Review Workflows
For enterprise use or dApps:

Backend generates a transaction with a durable nonce.

User gets time to review, sign, maybe counter-sign with a multisig.

Once ready, the signed transaction is sent.

‚úÖ Use Case: Legal contract approvals, treasury management, compliance workflows.

4. Pre-signed Transactions for Automation
Imagine:

A user signs a transaction with a durable nonce and sends it to a bot or script.

The script triggers the transaction at the right moment ‚Äî e.g., when an on-chain condition is met.

‚úÖ Use Case: Automated yield farming, DeFi bots, MEV protection.

üß™ Technical Note
When using a durable nonce:

The blockhash is replaced with a special nonce account's public key.

The transaction includes a NonceAdvance instruction.

All signers must sign a transaction with a durable nonce ‚Äî so partial signing is crucial if you‚Äôre gathering them asynchronously.

/*
recentBlockhash is an important value for a transaction. Your transaction will
be rejected if you use an expired blockhash (older than 150 blocks). Instead of a recent blockhash, you can use a durable nonce, which never expires. To use a durable nonce, your transaction must:

use a nonce stored in nonce account as a recent blockhash
put nonce advance operation in the first instruction
