/*USECASES FOR ASYNC and await
### **Use Cases of `async` and `await` in Blockchain Development**  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Interacting with Smart Contracts** ‚Äì Calling smart contract functions asynchronously (e.g., querying balances, sending transactions).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Fetching Blockchain Data** ‚Äì Retrieving blocks, transactions, and events from nodes without blocking execution.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Handling Multiple Wallet Connections** ‚Äì Managing multiple users interacting with a DApp.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Processing Transactions in Parallel** ‚Äì Submitting and confirming multiple transactions simultaneously.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Listening to Blockchain Events** ‚Äì Subscribing to real-time updates (e.g., detecting when a payment is received).  
6Ô∏è‚É£ **Decentralized Storage Access** ‚Äì Fetching data from IPFS or Arweave efficiently.  


1Ô∏è‚É£ HTTP Requests & APIs ‚Äì Fetching data from APIs (e.g., weather data) without blocking execution.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Web Servers ‚Äì Handling multiple users at once in web frameworks like actix-web.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Database Queries ‚Äì Running slow queries without freezing the app.
4Ô∏è‚É£ File I/O ‚Äì Reading/writing large files efficiently.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Background Tasks ‚Äì Running periodic tasks like sending emails or processing logs.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Concurrency ‚Äì Running multiple tasks simultaneously, like downloading multiple files at once.
