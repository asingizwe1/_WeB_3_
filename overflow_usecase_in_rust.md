Great question! Understanding when to use `checked_add` vs `wrapping_add` in Rust is key to writing safe and intentional arithmetic logic. Here's a breakdown to help you decide when each is appropriate:

---

### ✅ `u32::checked_add`
**Use when you want to detect and handle overflow.**

```rust
let a: u32 = u32::MAX;
let b: u32 = 1;
let result = a.checked_add(b); // returns None
```

#### 🔧 When to use:
- You **need to prevent overflow** (e.g., financial calculations, counters with strict limits).
- You want to **handle overflow gracefully**, like returning an error or skipping a step.
- You're writing **security-sensitive code** where overflow could lead to vulnerabilities.

#### 🧠 Example:
```rust
fn safe_increment(x: u32) -> Option<u32> {
    x.checked_add(1)
}
```

---

### 🔁 `u32::wrapping_add`
**Use when overflow is expected and acceptable.**

```rust
let a: u32 = u32::MAX;
let b: u32 = 1;
let result = a.wrapping_add(b); // wraps around to 0
```

#### 🔧 When to use:
- You're implementing **low-level arithmetic**, like cryptographic algorithms or hash functions.
- You want **modular arithmetic** behavior (e.g., counters that wrap around).
- Performance matters and you **don’t want the overhead** of checking for overflow.

#### 🧠 Example:
```rust
fn wrap_increment(x: u32) -> u32 {
    x.wrapping_add(1)
}
```

### 🧭 Summary Table

| Method             | Behavior on Overflow | Use Case                            |
|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `checked_add`      | Returns `None`       | Safe arithmetic, error handling     |
| `wrapping_add`     | Wraps around         | Modular math, performance-critical  |

If you're building something like a voucher issuance system or smart contract logic (which I know you're deep into), you'd typically lean toward `checked_add` to avoid silent bugs—unless you're doing something like nonce wrapping or cryptographic hashing, where `wrapping_add` might be intentional.
