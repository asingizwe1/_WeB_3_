/*
Solana, unlike Ethereum, doesnâ€™t have a gas bidding market by default. But during network congestion, users can increase their compute unit price to prioritize their transaction.
ðŸ’¥ Use Case: Congested Network
Imagine a popular NFT mint or DeFi launch:
Thousands of users send transactions at once.
Validators are overloaded.
Solana processes 1000s of transactions per second, but some may get dropped or delayed.
ðŸ’¡ With a priority fee, your transaction is more profitable for the validator to include in the next block.

âœ… When Would You Use This in Your Project?
If you're:

Writing a DeFi protocol with critical time-sensitive logic.

Launching an NFT minting app where users race to buy tokens.

Running a bot (like an MEV sniper or arbitrage tool).

Building a dApp that does multiple CPI (Cross Program Invocations) and may hit the default CU limit.

Deploying a backend that must submit high-priority instructions (like liquidations or staking updates).
