Compiles your contracts (using forge build if it‚Äôs a Foundry project).

Extracts the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) and bytecode.

Runs detectors for known security issues, such as:

Reentrancy vulnerabilities

Integer overflows/underflows (for pre-0.8.0 Solidity)

Uninitialized storage variables

Dangerous delegatecall usage

Centralization risks (e.g., onlyOwner everywhere)

Deprecated compiler features

Missing checks in transferFrom, etc.

So there‚Äôs no need to annotate your code with special comments.
Slither just needs:

Your contracts to compile successfully.

A foundry.toml (or truffle-config, hardhat config, etc.) in the project root, so it knows how to compile.

‚úÖ Example: Minimal Code That Slither Can Analyze

Here‚Äôs a small vulnerable contract that Slither would flag:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Vulnerable {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function deposit() external payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Not enough balance");
        (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{value: _amount}(""); // ‚ö†Ô∏è reentrancy risk
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
    }
}


When you run slither . on this project, you would get something like:

Reentrancy in withdraw() (Vulnerable.sol#15-21):
        External calls before state change

üìå Best Practices

No special tags needed. Just write Solidity normally.

Make sure the project compiles (forge build should work).

Run slither . from the root directory where foundry.toml is located.

Optionally, you can run:

slither . --print human-summary


to get a short, human-readable summary of issues.
