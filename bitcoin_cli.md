The bitcoin-cli is a command-line interface for interacting with the Bitcoin Core daemon (bitcoind). It lets you control a full Bitcoin node using RPC (Remote Procedure Calls). But unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin doesn't support smart contracts in the same way — so no Solidity-style contract creation here.

Key Uses of bitcoin-cli
Wallet Management Create, encrypt, backup, and interact with wallets. You can generate addresses, check balances, and send transactions.

Transaction Handling Build, sign, and broadcast Bitcoin transactions directly from the command line.

Blockchain Queries Get info about blocks, transactions, mempool, UTXOs (unspent outputs), and network status.

Node Control Start/stop the node, manage peers, and monitor sync status.

Automation & Scripting Integrate Bitcoin functionality into scripts or backend services — great for developers building wallets, explorers, or payment systems.

❌
What It’s Not Used For
Smart Contract Creation Bitcoin doesn’t use Solidity or support Turing-complete contracts. It has a scripting system (Bitcoin Script), but it’s limited and not used for general-purpose contracts like NFTs or DeFi.

DApp Development You won’t build decentralized apps with bitcoin-cli — that’s more in the realm of Ethereum, Solana, or MultiversX.

```javascript

bitcoin-cli sendtoaddress "1BitcoinAddress..." 0.001

```
This sends 0.001 BTC to a specified address — no GUI needed.

```javascript
developers use smart-contract-enabled layers built on top of Bitcoin. These layers extend Bitcoin’s functionality while preserving its security.

```
```javascript
